# Requirements & Caveats for Different Mod Platforms

## Basic Requirements:
A Windows, macOS, or Linux device that can run Minecraft: Java Edition.

## NeoForge:
Minecraft: Java Edition with NeoForge 1.21.4 installed.

### Caveats

No caveats since this was the platform it was built for.
**Use this version. It will keep all the features and run better on NeoForge.**

## Forge:
Minecraft: Java Edition with Forge 1.20.1 installed.

### Caveats

1. The Admin Bullets (used in Romeo's Glock) will be replaced with spectral arrows due to Java compatibility issues.

## Fabric (support coming soon):
Minecraft: Java Edition with Fabric 1.20.1.

## Production Info
Due to conversion compatibility issues, I will have to remake the source code in MCreator for Fabric support. I will add support in v2.0.0 stable.

Thanks for understanding.
